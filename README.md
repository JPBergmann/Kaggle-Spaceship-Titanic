*** Note: This competition is an introductionary challenge and performance is measured on a rolling leaderboard! ***

The current scores have all been achieved using "traditional" ML approaches. Specifically boosted trees and random forests yielded the best results. Using neural networks, the score can likely be improved upon further. However, I first want to explore the possibility of more feature engineering and possible outlier effects.
