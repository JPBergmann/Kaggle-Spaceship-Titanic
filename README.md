**Note: This competition is an introductionary challenge and performance is measured on a rolling leaderboard!**

Using neural networks, the score can likely be improved upon further. However, I first want to explore the possibility of more feature engineering and possible outlier effects.

Highest Score/Position achieved as of 29/06/2023 (out of 2628 teams):
